She had a Computer Science bachelor's degree at [University of Santa Catarina State][4] (2012). During her degree, she researched Affective Computing and Artificial Intelligence under the orientation of prof. Rogério Eduardo da Silva in a work entitled  ["Study and implementation of a EBDI model for cognitive agents applied in virtual actors"][5].

She researched Free Hardware and Software Socialization as part of a scholarship extension program in [Colmeia Group][6] for one year and a half (2009/2010). During this scholarship contributed for the development of a Linux distribution/mod for the University of Santa Catarina's Central Library and given talks and workshops to newcomers in free software.
